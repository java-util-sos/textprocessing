Lastly, one of the most popular false stereotypes is that all Muslim women are oppressed, and need help being liberated by the West; but when looking at the religious book of Islam, the Holy Quran, women are given the right to: pursue an education, vote, inherit land and wealth from their parents and even get a divorce if they want to. The use of these stereotypes only increased as the years went on especially after the 9/11 attacks in New York. The sheer number of times these offensive stereotypes have been used, for well over a century now, attest to the fact that most Western filmmakers have followed a particular narrative when representing Muslims in their work.\n\'\'\'',
