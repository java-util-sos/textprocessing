I will be using three types of samples to test my code:
  1. An Essay
  2. A page from a textbook
  3. Education Journal

I will be making two different prompts
  1. A prompt to extract the n amount of key points taken away from a piece of text and output it into the form of a JSON file
  2. A prompt to make questions based off of the results of the 1st prompt(above) and output it into the form of a JSON file
